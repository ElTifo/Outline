Thank you for using and supporting Outline & Ethereal. Unfortunately they aren't actively maintained anymore and won't receive regular updates.

They will stay available for free going forward because they still work and look great. You can find more information here: bit.ly/outlineDiscontinuation

This update removes all anti-piracy protections and fixes the Google Icon in Settings.

I am sorry and hope you can understand.
